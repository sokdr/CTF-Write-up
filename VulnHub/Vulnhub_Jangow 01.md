At first we run ``nmap`` tool to find open ports.

``FTP`` 21 and port 80 are open, lets access the web ports.

![web](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20625004/165245967-c18326be-036d-4409-8ba8-5edba65a83a3.PNG)

Lets use ``gobuster`` to find any interesting paths.

Nothing intersting, now lets go back and access ``site`` path.

![site](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20625004/165246346-c191ce92-dced-4fad-8b94-16bce9c244e4.PNG)

Looking around, nothing seems to be anything of interest except for the ``Buscar`` page found.

![buscar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20625004/165246526-91b83312-4cd2-46bb-92ff-931a8021b7ed.PNG)

We should check the parameter ``buscar`` for command injection.

It seems it is working, i tried reverse shell but nothing worked, so lets look around with commands.

![command_injection2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20625004/165247903-cc094986-7cd8-4820-8a83-e1c1abda6e3b.PNG)

We found users ``jangow01`` and ``desafio02``. lets access the home directory of user ``jangow01``.

![user_flag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20625004/165248265-4e83f30a-b3e2-46ee-a951-8e44067e3f85.PNG)

We found the _user flag_, nice.

Earlier with command ``ls - l`` in parameter ``buscar`` we found some paths, access ``wordpress``.

In ``wordpress`` there is a configuration file ``config.php``.

![config](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20625004/165250726-c4b12f59-0edb-4a5c-9819-6620bd2f5abb.PNG)

The files contains username and password, use that on the ``FTP`` service we found earlier with ``nmap``.

We accesssed the ``FTP`` with user _``desafio02``_ without any success and then with user _``jangow01``_ with success, digging around showed nothing.

After digging around with no success, lets access the target vm, with user _``jangow01_``.

![vm1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20625004/165254583-f53626f2-e10a-4a35-9394-0fe56099d892.PNG)

Lets search for any exploits regarding the target's kernel version. After searching and trials and erros i found this exploit.

_https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45010_ 

Download it and complile it.

``gcc ./file -o file``

After we uploaded the file on the target maching from the ``FTP`` access.

Then by changing the persmission of the file ``chmod +x file`` we executed the exploit and escalated our privileges.

On ``root`` folder you will find the _root_flag_.
